# Student-Score-Prediction
Student performance prediction is a critical area in education, enabling educators to identify students at risk and improve overall academic outcomes. This report explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict and analyze student performance based on various features, including academic scores, attendance, socio-economic background, parental education levels, and extracurricular involvement. By leveraging supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes, along with regression models, this study aims to build an efficient and scalable prediction system.

The dataset, sourced from educational institutions or publicly available repositories, undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data. Feature engineering and selection techniques are employed to identify the most impactful predictors, while data visualization helps uncover hidden trends and correlations. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure reliability and practical applicability.

The findings aim to provide actionable insights for educators, enabling data-driven interventions to enhance learning experiences and student outcomes. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of ethical considerations, such as data privacy and unbiased model design, in implementing machine learning solutions in education. This report underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in creating equitable, efficient, and personalized educational systems for diverse learning communities.
